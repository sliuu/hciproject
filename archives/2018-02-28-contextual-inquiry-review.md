## Key Findings & Takeaways

We have thus far conducted four different interviews, and are planning on at least one more by the end of the week. We’ve uncovered a lot of information about people’s experience with art in the process. We learned that people often view art in relation to their lives, and that for some people with no formal art background, drawing similarities to different aspects of their lives is how they interact with it. In that vain, we also learned that direction is sometimes needed to guide social conversations about art, to prevent them from devolving into mere speculation. We also learned that navigating a museum’s exhibits correctly is an important part of the museum experience, and that different genres of art should be treated differently (some art is consumed together, as an exhibit, others individually). We learned that information can enhance the museum experience, but too much information can also distract the viewer.

## Process

We have performed most of our inquiries as a combination of a semi-structured interview and a traditional contextual inquiry. Since our app is not meant to replace an existing practice as much as provide a new feature and aspect to engagement with art, we found that the traditional contextual inquiry would not be enough for us. Instead, we started our inquiries with semi-structured interviews to get a sense of the user and their experience with art and museums in generals, and then moved to simply observing what users would say to us in real time about different art pieces to glean some understanding of what kinds of questions they might want answered and what their perspective on different art pieces was. 

## Contextual Inquiry Participants

Our first contextual inquiry participant was an Art History professor at the University of Rochester. We interviewed her at MASS MoCA while walking around some exhibits. We noticed her struggle with figuring out how best to navigate exhibits, as there weren’t good directions in the museum. She also noted that although she believes discussion can be helpful in understanding art, there should be some kind of direction in the conversation or else it devolves into speculation. 

Our second participant was actually a couple, two students from MCLA and Worcester State University. We interviewed them at MASS MoCA while walking around the James Turrell exhibit. They were both somewhat interested in art, but had no formal training in Art or Art History. Because they had no formal education in art, I noticed that many of their comments were about art in relation to different things in their lives (many “this reminds me of…” comments). In addition, they learned a lot through museum staff and other museum-goers about the exhibits, but didn’t spend much time reading placards or pamphlets. 

Our third participant was a Williams student who occasionally visits museums and has an interest in art, but has no formal background knowledge. He expressed a particular frustration with contemporary, conceptual art that doesn’t allow him to engage in the subject matter as much as less abstract, traditional pieces. This has led him to pay less attention to contemporary art. However, he wouldn’t necessarily want a very formal understanding of art and likes to leave some of his understanding to individual interpretation. Additionally, in order to probe what the current process for learning about art looks like, we conducted a contextual inquiry, asking him to describe his process looking at a few modern pieces. After looking at a Jackson Pollack and not gleaning much from the work, he continued to search for more information on his own. His search evinced the difficulty both in finding a trustworthy, centralized resource for art and in comprehending the language of formal art terms.

Our fourth contextual inquiry was with an elderly couple. They were looking at a modern art installation about violence. One mentioned that he was an engineer and he could not understand modern art. The other indicated that the museum pamphlets helped them make sense of the art. Although they did not have a full understanding of the exhibit, it was clear that it had an effect on the couple. They were not very comfortable with modern art, and they felt their experience needed to be directed. The couple visits museums every couple months, and they have never had trouble interpreting traditional art.

Our fifth contextual inquiry was with Alice and Bob (names changed), a young couple at MASS MoCA. They were observing a large modern art installation. They did not have any formal background in art. Their interest in art was casual, and they visit museums about 6 times a year. We noticed that the couple felt very strongly about art. They expressed that art helped them make sense of their lives. They connect art to their everyday life. Their museum experience was very personal.

## Contextual Inquiry Themes and Process
From our contextual inquiries, we:
- Confirmed that learning is the ultimate goal for art museum-goers
- Discovered these learning experiences are unique to the individual, 
- And so resources that support this endeavor must be customizable.

Learning as the primary goal of museum-goers reinforces the necessity of a more accessible resource, which was our initial intuition. The presence of context and background information on art are integral to this learning process. Our inquiries also illuminated the current lack of such a convenient resource that appropriately communicates context. The current gap in information disclosure is due to the limited physical space in museums to disseminate information to users in the form of placards and wall text, and to the inconvenient and often unused circulation of pamphlets. This apparent mismatch in communicating context confirms the motivation for our design solution. In addition, social discussion is only one aspect of learning, but is a crucial part in gaining new knowledge in an informal way.

We also uncovered on a high level the nature of the learning experience when it comes to art. Because we are dealing with the subjective experience of enjoying art, the entire journey of art learning at museums must also accommodate a range of individual experiences. This personalization must be considered at all points of the learning experience, starting with the initial art background and interest level of the users to how and what they aim to learn. We learned that people enjoy relating art back to their own lives, so they must be able to practice individuality when engaging with any kind of art. In wanting to maintain their autonomy, they may explicitly choose not to learn too much background information about an art piece, and may simply want to engage with it themselves. Users must be able to make this choice for themselves. Social discussion plays a large part in this; it allows users to participate in an informal discussion about art that allows them to gain new knowledge, and yet it still allows them to express their individually. An example of this is when we noticed museum-goers asking museum staff specific questions about art pieces. This was one avenue through which they were able to tailor the amount of background knowledge they wanted to their needs. 

Through affinity diagramming, we were able to identify these high-level themes, as shown by the pink and purple post-its in the diagram above. By grouping similar statements from our interviewees together, we were able to pinpoint commonalities in the learning experience in art museums. For example, we noticed that the Art History professor stated that placards are informative but can be distracting, and actually both students noted that too much background information can actually take away from their appreciation of an artwork. To us, this meant that users would want to customize and tailor their learning to fit their needs. We used this kind of process to move from specific statements by specific users to general statements about groups of users throughout the construction of our affinity diagram.
