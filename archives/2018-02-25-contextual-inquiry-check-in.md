## Setup

Our entire team went to MASS MoCA on Saturday and each interviewed a different demographic for about 30 minutes to an hour each. 

## Interviews

### Group A:
_Demographic:_ Two students, aged 19 and 21, at MCLA and Worcester State University.

_Background:_ Both students had some experience with art, with one being only tangentially interested in art, going to museums around once a year, and the other (at MCLA) visiting MASS MoCA whenever there was a new exhibit, but both not having any formal art history background. 

_Insights:_ As I walked around the museum with them, I noticed that because they didn’t have much art history background, they mostly commented on what different artworks reminded them of (eg. “the lights look like the aurora borealis”). I also noticed that they got tips or insights from others in the museum and the museum staff. As we walked into one exhibit, an older man suggested we “get up close and look at it from the side.” In a Turrell exhibit, they asked a staffer “how big is the room?” and “how did they create the hazy effect?”. Their questions about the different artworks were mostly where the inspiration came from, but they noted that they just wanted some and not too much information because “just a little bit of background information can spark your imagination.” The Turrell exhibit also made me realize that some exhibits don’t allow photos, so we may want to think about a new way of recognizing which exhibits people are in. I also noticed that many artworks in MASS MoCA are not intended to be consumed piece by piece, but rather as an entire exhibit, so it may make more sense in some cases to set up our “art profiles” by exhibit rather than artwork. 

_Issues:_ I found that I wanted to probe them with more questions about the art, but I also didn’t want to steer their understanding of art in one way or another. For example, I wanted to know what kinds of background information they were interested in, but I felt like if I directly asked “would you want to know how modern art slowly evolved into different pieces like this?” or “would you be curious about related artists?” I would automatically get a “yes” answer even if they didn’t, so I didn’t know how to approach that. I didn’t have any difficulty establishing rapport, but I think that was made easier because the two were my age.

### Group B:

A young couple who expressed a casual interest in art, one noted that art for him was “another lens for him to understand his place in life” and “a stimulus to spark a reflection on himself”. 

### Group C:

An elderly couple who noted that they preferred traditional art, and read the pamphlets at MASS MoCA because they couldn’t understand modern art.

## Going Forward

We plan to interview at least two more people, a student at Williams and an art history professor. The interview with the student is currently set for Monday. The interviews with both the student and professor will hopefully be at WCMA if they have time, so we can have some probes handy to ask specific questions. We will try to use tape recorders for the next interviews (if they’re okay with it), because we found that it was difficult to jot notes down while standing at the museum. We need to plan more “go-to” questions as well; we wanted to do the interviews very unstructured, but found it was hard to come up with the right phrasing for questions we wanted on the spot. We may also see if we can get another professor or student to do some journaling at a museum for us (documenting their opinions on different artworks), but this is definitely more time-intensive for them.
