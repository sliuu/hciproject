        <p>Our design aims to promote a more inclusive community centered around public art. Our target users are those who lack the formal background knowledge to more deeply appreciate and learn about art pieces seen in museums. 
Providing a resource that allows people to learn more about and discuss art also creates a valuable information source for general use and research. The potentially multi-faceted application of our design broadens our users to include not only those who don’t know much about art but also those who do–such as art historians and the artists themselves. We plan to conduct contextual inquiries on the following subjects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Art History Professor. Art history professors at Williams are not only passionate about but also have years of experience engaging and teaching students with no previous background in art. We have already reached out to one professor, and are currently awaiting a response. The interview will be conducted in the professor’s office sometime early next week. We have some backup professors lined up too, since we are all in Art history classes this semester.</li>
  <li>A student. We would like to target a student that has visited museums in his lifetime and is interested in art, but does not yet have any background knowledge. We have reached out to a friend of Joyce’s, so Stephanie/Cliff will conduct the interview.</li>
  <li>Random museum-goers. We plan to sit in a museum like MASS MoCA, and survey individuals who are carefully looking at art pieces. We will sit in the last room of Tanja Hollander’s exhibit; it provides a nice space with sofas and tables, allows conversation, and already provokes interaction with the art. We will also spend some time candidly observing people visiting the museum, and will record how often they stop to look at artworks and whether groups of visitors spend time discussing various artworks with each other.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>We will be conducting our interviews in multiple settings, as mentioned above. The location for the student interview will be Tunnel City because it provides a casual and familiar atmosphere, and features various artworks on the walls. We will use a semi-structured interview style, because we are still in the exploratory stage. We will start our interviews with a brief introduction to our project proposal, but then quickly steer the conversation to broader probing questions about the interviewee’s relationship to art. We will be observing people at the museum, but for the one-on-one interviews we will ask them questions about how often they engage with art, how they engage, what their opinions are on the art world, and what they’d like to learn about art. Potential questions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How often do you visit museums?</li>
  <li>How much do you know about art?</li>
  <li>We will probe each interviewee with the same piece of art, and ask them what their first reactions are, to get a sense of how different people will comment on the art in the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the Professor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you think people should look at art?</li>
  <li>What do you feel is the value in informal evaluations of art?</li>
  <li>How helpful are discussions to an understanding of art?</li>
</ul>
