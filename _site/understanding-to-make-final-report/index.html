<p>Art for All: An interactive and educational platform for public engagement at art museums</p>

<h2 id="team-members">Team Members</h2>
<p>Joyce Wang, Stephanie Liu, and Cliff Makanda. We have decided to all serve as generalists on the team, to get a chance to try out all of the roles and act as equal team members.</p>

<h2 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h2>
<p>Art museums have long been a primary resource for learning about and experiencing art. Unfortunately, art can often feel intimidatingly inaccessible for the general public. For regular people, who aren’t academics or involved in the “art world,” art can feel elusive, out-of-touch, or even perhaps just confusing. Without a formal introduction to art, which is generally only available to the privileged, it becomes difficult to glean much insight from abstract and unfamiliar artworks. This problem stems from both the little information museums provide about artworks as well as the lack of informal resources available for engaging in conversations about art. Art for All intends to overcome these hurdles by providing a simple and easy-to-use framework for finding background information about artworks and artists, and allowing users to engage in informal discussions about specific artworks online. In this way, users from a diverse set of backgrounds can come together to discuss their varied interpretations of art to get a better understanding of how art can impact their lives. In addition, background information will be readily accessible and easy to understand.</p>

<h2 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h2>
<p>This <a href="../paper-prototype">post</a> shows an overview of the initial paper prototype we constructed, that would be used for later testing. It also demonstrates how the prototype would be used to carry out each of our two main tasks.</p>

<h2 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h2>
<p>This <a href="../testing-process">post</a> outlines the heuristic evaluations and usability tests we conducted with our initial paper prototype in order to refine and iterate on our design. It also includes revisions we made to our testing format and what we learned from the initial tests.</p>

<h2 id="testing-results">Testing Results</h2>
<p>This <a href="../testing-results">post</a> details the key results we learned from each of our tests, and the subsequent revisions we made to our paper prototype.</p>

<h2 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype</h2>
<p>After receiving feedback from the heuristic evaluations and usability tests, we constructed a new final paper prototype that can be found <a href="../final-paper-prototype">here</a>. The post outlines all the changes made from critiques, as well as walkthroughs of how the final paper prototype would be used in each of our two key tasks.</p>

<h2 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h2>
<p>We used Sketch and InVision to create our digital mockup. This <a href="../final-digital-mock-up">post</a> presents an overview of our design as well as walkthroughs using the design for each of our two main tasks. It also includes any revisions we made moving from paper to digital, as well as those we made after receiving feedback on our initial digital mockup.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>We learned a lot about the process of iterative design, and found the techniques really helpful in refining our design. We didn’t realize how many issues could come up, even with the limited functionality we used in our paper prototype. The heuristic evaluations provided a solid foundation for us to go off of, and then the usability tests provided more subjective tweaks that enhanced the design in different ways. We also refined the process of our usability tests as we learned about what aspects of the tests we wanted to change. Our primary tasks did not actually change much as a result of the usability tests, probably because they were so straight forward to begin with. However, our design certainly changed a lot as we received feedback and critiques. We probably did just about the right number of iterations necessary for our limited design scope. We certainly could have done more, and would have tweaked the design in helpful ways, but the marginal benefits would have likely started tapering off eventually. That being said, the design would not be nearly as good as it is now had it not been for the iterative design approach. We quickly realized that we were assuming background knowledge that our users might not have when we created our inital paper prototype, and had to refine our design to be more explicit about its functionality. The launch page was an example of a key revision we needed to make in order to allow the user to build an efficient “mental model” of the scope of the app. We also realized that we built the initial paper prototype in one direction (click these buttons to get here), but often forgot about back buttons and “emergency exits” that we had to add in later. These changes made our app much more intuitive and easy to use for all of our users.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="instructions-for-usability-tests">Instructions for Usability Tests</h3>
<p>Below are the instructions we read out loud and printed for our usability testing participants to refer to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a study about an educational and social platform for learning about artworks in museums and discussing the art with others. Our goal is to make the app as appealing, usable, and intuitive as possible. Your input and observations will help us refine our design.<br />
We will provide a “paper prototype” for you to use as you carry about the main tasks that we are designing for. Another team member will be writing notes as you carry out these tasks. Feel free to ask us questions as you carry out the tasks, but know that we may not always be able to answer right away because we won’t be there for our future users. Please try to talk aloud as you move through the tasks, so we can understand what’s going on in your head.<br />
All of the information we collect from this study will be anonymized after, and we will not videotape or record you.<br />
Remember that we are testing the product, not you! Don’t worry if you don’t understand something or get confused. Those insights will help us understand where our design has failed and where we may need to make the design more clear.<br />
Know that you can quit at any time. Your participation is valuable to us, but is entire voluntary.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="task-descriptions-for-usability-tests">Task Descriptions for Usability Tests</h3>

<p>After our first usability test, we decided to print out task descriptions to hand out to participants. They would read the task description out loud before attempting to carry out the task with the paper prototype. We printed out the task descriptions on separate sheets of paper.</p>

<h3 id="task-1-finding-background-information">Task 1: Finding Background Information</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You are in a museum looking at different artworks. You come across a piece you’d like to learn more about, and you see a QR code on the placard next to the piece. You’re specifically interested in finding out what the artist’s inspiration was when creating this piece. Please try to find this information by looking it up using the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="task-2-discussing-art-with-others">Task 2: Discussing Art with Others</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now that you have found the inspiration for this piece, you might want to discuss what the piece means to you with others. Please try and add to the discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="task-25-catching-up-with-your-discussions">Task 2.5: Catching Up with Your Discussions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>After leaving the museum, you get a notification on your phone that someone has replied to your comment. Starting from the main screen, try to navigate back to the comment you made to see what their response was.</p>
</blockquote>
