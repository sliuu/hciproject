        <h2 id="method-overview-and-refinements">Method Overview and Refinements</h2>

<p>We conducted two types of tests: heuristics evaluations and usability tests.</p>

<p>The heuristic evaluations were carried out according to Nielsen’s heuristics sheet, and we had two different groups evaluate our design. The evaluators identified potential issues with our design, noted the heuristics violated, and assigned a severity score to each issue. For detailed images of the evaluator’s comments, refer to the <a href="../heuristic-evaluations">Heuristic Evaluations page</a>.</p>

<p>For our usability tests, we followed the test protocol outlined in Kathleen Gomoll’s, “Some Techniques for Observing Users,” starting with a brief explanation of the app, and the format and rules for the usability test. The exact wording and specifications we used can be found in the Appendix of our <a href="../understanding-to-make-final-report">final report</a>.  We then explained each of our two main tasks in a scenario format, and asked the user to carry out the tasks. For the first usability test, Stephanie was the facilitator, and Joyce took notes. After our first usability test, we found that by not actually writing down the tasks and giving them to our participant to refer to, the conversation often derailed into other topics that did not pertain to the task. In our subsequent tests, we then refined our approach by printing out the tasks for our participants, and found that it helped the test stay focused. In addition, we updated our pre-test briefings to be more specific about the goals of the usability test. Cliff conducted the second test, and Joyce took notes. We found that the second test was in fact much more streamlined, and the printed out tasks were very helpful in making the process more explicit. The last test was conducted by Joyce while Stephanie took notes.</p>

<h2 id="participants">Participants</h2>

<p>Our first usability test was conducted with a Williams College senior, in a study room in Sawyer Library. We chose to start with him because he sits in the upper-end in terms of his art education and background. He is not an art history major but has taken four art history classes at Williams and has a deep appreciation for art. We explained each of our two main tasks in a scenario format and asked him to carry out those tasks while explaining his thought process and asking questions (even if we couldn’t answer them).</p>

<p>The second usability test participant was with a Williams College junior. We chose him because he had little background in art education, and only visited museums very infrequently. The test was again conducted in Sawyer Library. We started by laying out written brief scenarios of being in the museum and approaching a painting. Both the second and third usability tests differed from the first test in that the participants were provided with written scenarios and were asked to read them out loud and refer to them as they carried out the two tasks.</p>

<p>The last usability test participant was with a Williams College senior. She has taken a few art history courses for fun, but does not have a strong background in art. She also expressed a particular interest in this kind of app, because she often finds herself not understanding the art she sees at museums. The test was also conducted in Sawyer.</p>

<p>Our heuristics evaluations were carried out as part of an in-class exercise with two different groups. Joyce and Stephanie facilitated the first evaluation which was performed by Karl. Cliff facilitated the last evaluation which was performed by Alyssa and Lester. The evaluators were familiar with our project and with Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The groups simulated first time users, asked questions, noted any heuristics broken, and indicated the severities.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Conducting usability tests and heuristic evaluations provided helpful insight into the problems and challenges that might be encountered by users using our app for the first time. Asking the usability test participants to read the tasks out loud, talk us through their actions, and ask questions, helped us understand their thought process while using the app. Several issues were identified through the usability test and heuristic evaluations. The usability tests highlighted that some of our design choices needed to be better refined to be clearly understood by the users. Heuristic evaluations provided a systematic way to evaluate our app design. Our use of different groups with different levels of experience for our use cases made our testing process effective.</p>
