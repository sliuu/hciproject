## Project
Art for All: An interactive and educational platform for public engagement at art museums

## Team Members (all generalists): 
Cliff Makanda, Stephanie Liu, Joyce Wang

## Problem and Solution Overview:
Art museums have long been a primary resource for learning about and experiencing art. Unfortunately, art can often feel intimidatingly inaccessible for the general public. For regular people, who aren’t academics or involved in the “art world,” art can feel elusive, out-of-touch, or even perhaps just confusing. Without a formal introduction to art, which is generally only available to the privileged, it becomes difficult to glean much insight from abstract and unfamiliar artworks. This problem stems from both the little information museums provide about artworks as well as the lack of informal resources available for engaging in conversations about art. Art for All intends to overcome these hurdles by providing a simple and easy-to-use framework for finding background information about artworks and artists, and allowing users to engage in informal discussions about specific artworks online. In this way, users from a diverse set of backgrounds can come together to discuss their varied interpretations of art to get a better understanding of how art can impact their lives. In addition, background information will be readily accessible and easy to understand. 

## Design Research: Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants

This [post](../design-research-goals-stakeholders-and-participants) provides information about the methods and process we used for gathering design research through interviews and contextual inquiries, as well as detailed accounts of the participants, their backgrounds, and the environments in which they were interviewed.

## Design Research: Results and Themes

This [post](../design-research-results-and-themes) provides an overview of the key results and themes from our design research, as found through affinity diagramming. The emergence of these key themes allowed us to guide our design to specifically tailor user needs. 

## Task Analysis

This [post](../task-analysis) details our answers to specific task analysis questions, and allows us to set the scope of our design as it relates to the users. 

## Proposed Design Sketches (“3x4”)

This [post](../Proposed-Design-Sketches-3-x-4) presents three different potential design choices, and details the specific tasks they are designed to support. An updated design is presented at the end, with an explanation for why that specific design was ultimately chosen. 

## Written Scenarios (“1x2”)

This [post](../Written-Scenarios-1-x-2) details the two selected tasks we chose to support in our final design, and written scenarios for each task that correspond to the storyboards as presented in the next section.

## Storyboards

This [post](../Storyboards) presents the two storyboards that correspond to our selected tasks.
