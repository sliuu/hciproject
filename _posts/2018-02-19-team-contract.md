## 1. TEAM CONTACT INFORMATION

The group will communicate through GroupMe and/or Facebook Messenger. Urgent matters may be communicated through email. Joyce has commitments for NBC at night, so we’ll usually meet during the day. We are sharing our Google Calendars so we get an idea of when we’re all free. Our goal is to create a great project we’re proud of in the end!

## 2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

- We will work as a team, and less as a working group.
- We will create a collaborative learning environment that is comfortable for everyone.
- We want everyone to feel satisfied with and proud of their individual contributions.
- We will be invested in the success of this project.
- We will put the team’s needs before individual needs (there’s no I in team!).
 
## 3. PRELIMINARY FOCUS ON PURPOSE

 The goal of this project is to bring art engagement to people who would otherwise be intimidated by art. We want to make art accessible by creating a user-friendly and welcoming platform for discussions. Our customer-base will be anyone who is familiar with tech and sees value in participating in online forums for art.

## 4. GROUP ROLES

We are all generalists and all members are expected to prepare for meetings, participate in meetings, complete assigned tasks, and support the efforts of other team members.

Group roles will be assigned on a case-by-case basis. They will be determined by assigned tasks. Every member is a leader and should conduct themselves as such. It is the responsibility of all members to be aware of what needs to be done. 

## 5. DIVIDING UP THE TASK:  THE DIVISION OF LABOR

- Tasks will be divided according to expressed strengths and weaknesses, or desires.
- We will divide the work by action items/deadlines and balance among members.  
- Everyone should contribute equally, but members are encouraged to volunteer for the assignments they are most interested in or think they can contribute the most to. 
- Everyone will work to look over finished assignments or projects before the final push.

## 6. TEAM PLAN

At the beginning of every meeting we will set-up a weekly plan. This plan will depend on the project requirements of the professor, and the assigned tasks.


## 7. MEETING MANAGEMENT

We will meet as needed, but at least once a week. The location of the meeting will be determined through GroupMe and/or at the previous meeting. Meetings will be scheduled according to common free times in the Google Calendar, and the length will be determined by the tasks to be addressed. Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of members to communicate ahead of time if they are to be late or will miss a scheduled meeting.

During meetings we will reinforce positive attitudes and constructively deal with problems. The focus of the task will be determined by the requirements and direction of the class instructor. Members are encouraged to offer constructive suggestions, comments and criticism. One person will talk at a time. Group members should pay attention and stick to the agenda at hand. All members will contribute to the meeting. Decisions are determined by majority rule. Conflicts will be solved through negotiation and understanding. 

## 8. ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS

- Completed tasks are presented at the beginning of every meeting.
- If a group member encounters a challenge while completing a task, they should inform other members before the next meeting.
- If a group member is unable to complete a task before a set meeting, he/she should inform the others with plenty of time in advance.
- We will schedule intermediate peer review meetings for larger projects. 
- Project benchmarks will be task specific and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. They are assigned at the conclusion of every meeting. Members are expected to meet and/or exceed benchmarks. 
- Completed tasks are reviewed by all group members at the beginning of every meeting.

## 9. REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS

- The group will accept feedback both negative and positive. 
- Points will be determined by member contribution which we expect to be equal.
- We will celebrate team success through high fives.
- We reward individual initiative and contribution by giving compliments.
- We handle non-performance and failure to meet commitments through communication. All group members should be open to constructive criticism. 
- Behavior that disrupts group function should be communicated and addressed during group meetings, and can be brought up by anyone in the team.
- Negative internal feedback should not be viewed as personal, and is meant to improve the performance of the team as a whole. External feedback applies to all group members, not any particular member.

## 10. FOLLOW-UP

- The contract will be revised as the team majority sees fit.
- Issues that are not covered in the contract will be decided through majority rule, and they will be incorporated into the contract.
