## Key Findings and Results

Through our research, we uncovered a lot of information about people’s experience with art. We learned that people often view art in relation to their lives. Most people, with no formal art background, interact with art by drawing similarities to different aspects of their lives. In that vain, we also learned that direction is sometimes needed to guide social conversations about art, to prevent them from devolving into mere speculation. We also learned that correctly navigating a museum’s exhibits is an important aspect of the museum experience, and that different genres of art should be treated differently (some art is consumed together, as an exhibit, others individually). We learned that information can enhance the museum experience, but too much information can also distract the viewer.

## Design Research Themes
From our contextual inquiries, we:
- Confirmed that learning is the ultimate goal for art museum-goers
- Discovered these learning experiences are unique to the individual 
- Resources that support learning about art must be customizable

Learning as the primary goal of museum-goers reinforces the necessity of a more accessible resource, which was our initial intuition. The presence of context and background information on art are integral to this learning process. Our inquiries also illuminated the current lack of such a convenient resource that appropriately communicates context. The current gap in information disclosure is due to the limited physical space in museums to disseminate information to users in the form of placards and wall text, and to the inconvenient and often unused circulation of pamphlets. This apparent mismatch in communicating context confirms the motivation for our design solution. In addition, social discussion is only one aspect of learning, but is a crucial part in gaining new knowledge in an informal way.

We also uncovered on a high level the nature of the learning experience when it comes to art. Because we are dealing with the subjective experience of enjoying art, the entire journey of art learning at museums must also accommodate a range of individual experiences. This personalization must be considered at all points of the learning experience, starting with the initial art background and interest level of the users to how and what they aim to learn. We learned that people enjoy relating art back to their own lives, so they must be able to practice individuality when engaging with any kind of art. In wanting to maintain their autonomy, they may explicitly choose not to learn too much background information about an art piece, and may simply want to engage with it themselves. Users must be able to make this choice for themselves. Social discussion plays a large part in this; it allows users to participate in an informal discussion about art that allows them to gain new knowledge, and yet it still allows them to express their individually. An example of this is when we noticed museum-goers asking museum staff specific questions about art pieces. This was one avenue through which they were able to tailor the amount of background knowledge they wanted to their needs. 

Through affinity diagramming, we were able to identify these high-level themes, as shown by the pink and purple post-its in the diagram above. By grouping similar statements from our interviewees together, we were able to pinpoint commonalities in the learning experience in art museums. For example, we noticed that the Art History professor stated that placards are informative but can be distracting, and actually both students noted that too much background information can actually take away from their appreciation of an artwork. To us, this meant that users would want to customize and tailor their learning to fit their needs. We used this kind of process to move from specific statements by specific users to general statements about groups of users throughout the construction of our affinity diagram.
