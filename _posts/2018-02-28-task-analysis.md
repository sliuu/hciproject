## 1. Who is going to use the design?
Our main target users will be people who are interested in art and enjoy going to museums, but don’t necessarily have any formal background or training in art. We would also like to target users who study art formally, such as students, Art History professors and researchers, etc. We think their input will provide a valuable source of information for the general discussions on artworks, and may help guide the conversations in more productive ways. Lastly, we may want to involve museum curators in the process, to allow them to tailor “art profiles” based on the layouts of the exhibits and to provide relevant information (the same kind of information they might currently provide in pamphlets scattered throughout the museum). This would be an extension on the design, time permitting.

## 2. What tasks do they now perform?
In the museum, users are currently able to glean information from placards, wall text/artist bios, and pamphlets. They can engage with the art in a more social way by talking to their friends, other museum-goers (if they are out-going people), or museum staff. Outside the museum, users interested in art might perform informal individual searches on art pieces or artists to learn extra information. Museum curators are responsible for putting together exhibits, deciding what kinds of information to put in artists bios and placards and what to leave out, and deciding whether to include additional pamphlets. 

## 3. What tasks are desired?
Users should be able to gain new knowledge about different pieces of art at their own pace. Users should be able to learn about artists, their inspiration, and any other relevant information about the piece. Users should be able to comment on artworks, read about others’ perspectives, and reply to others’ comments to spark a conversation. Users should be able to individualize their experience and feel personally connected to the art. This could mean being able to save artworks as “favorites,” or something else. Curators should be able to update information about exhibits, remove intolerant comments, provide helpful background information, and engage with the users themselves.

## 4. How are the tasks learned?
Because our product will be in the form of a mobile/web application, the learning process for users should be relatively straightforward. We will try to make the interface similar to other social interfaces to make the adoption very seamless. However, because this is an app for all ages, the tasks may also be learned at the museum (museum staff could be trained to teach a basic outline of how to use the app, if needed). If the museum curator aspect gets more complicated, learning will be at the design level (e.g. a short tutorial at the beginning).  

## 5. Where are the tasks performed?
The main focus will be users using the app while navigating museums, but there are additional use cases where the user might want to look back on exhibits he’s viewed in the past and comment on them, so we don’t restrict location. In addition, users may want to use the data as a resource for learning outside the museum. Curators will naturally be performing tasks at the museum or in their offices when planning out new exhibits. 

## 6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
Because this is an online forum and we would like to limit intolerant behavior, comments will be public and linked to the person’s profile, but we will collect limited data about the person, and only as much as the user is willing to provide (we will not require much). The data regarding user comments should persist at least throughout the lifetime of the exhibit, and may be archived after. The data the museum curator provides (through background information, pictures, etc.) can be controlled by the curator herself, and she may archive or delete the data as she sees fit. Data should be updated frequently to bring up the newest comments and spark ongoing conversation. 

## 7. What other tools does the person have?
Placards and pamphlets throughout museums are the current tools people have to learn new information about art and artists in museums. In addition, they have museum staff and other museum-goers to talk to. To establish individual relationships with art, users currently can buy postcards at museum gift shops as memorabilia of their favorite works. To learn additional information, users can also look up background information on artists or exhibits on their phone, but this may be a rather inefficient way of finding the relevant information. 

## 8. How do people communicate with each other?
Users will be able to leave comments, similar to comments sections in other social places (like Reddit, Youtube, etc.). They will be able to reply to others’ comments, start new comment threads, and read others’ perspectives. Users who have studied art formally will play a special role in this conversation, and may help guide the discussion or else inform the discussion with relevant background. 

## 9. How often are the tasks performed?
From our survey data, people seem to visit museums once a month to once a year, and this is when we’d expect people to perform the tasks most often. For museum curators, exhibits change frequently and the curators may want to regularly catch up with how users are reacting to their different exhibits. 

## 10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
There aren’t any hard constraints on the tasks here, but since people spend limited time at a museum, they will likely not spend too much time on each individual “art profile.” How much time they do choose to spend will depend on the complexity of the art piece to the user and how interested the user is in that particular work. For the museum curators, there also won’t be any hard constraints, but we imagine they will want to be able to complete their tasks quickly and smoothly. 

## 11. What happens when things go wrong?
Fake news (spreading of false information masquerading as facts), conversations devolving into mere speculations rather than a genuine understanding of the art, and intolerant behavior or hate speech that is unproductive and uninformative (trolls).
