## Method Overview
 
We conducted two types of tests: heuristics evaluations and usability tests. For our usability tests, we followed the test protocol outlined in Kathleen Gomoll’s, “Some Techniques for Observing Users,” starting with a brief explanation of the app, and the format and rules for the usability test. We explained each of our two main tasks in a scenario format, and asked the user to carry out the tasks. For the first usability test, Stephanie was the facilitator, and Joyce took notes. Cliff conducted the second test, and Joyce took notes. The last test was conducted by Joyce while Stephanie took notes. Our heuristic evaluations were carried out according to Nielsen’s heuristics sheet. The evaluators identified potential issues with our design, noted the heuristic violated, and assigned a severity score.
 
## Participants
 
Our first usability test was with a Williams College senior, in a study room at the Sawyer Library. We chose to start with him because he sits in the middle in terms of his art education and background. He was not an art history major but had taken four art history classes at Williams and had a deep appreciation for art. We explained each of our two main tasks in a scenario format and asked him to carry out those tasks while explaining his thought process and asking questions (even if we couldn’t answer them).
 
The second usability test participant was with a Williams College junior. We chose him because he was familiar with the purpose of the app and its use cases. The test was conducted in the Sawyer Library, a quiet space. We started by laying out written brief scenarios of being in the museum and approaching a painting. Both the second and third usability tests are differed from the first test in that the participants were provided with written scenarios and asked to read out loud and refer to the paper throughout the test.
 
The last usability test participant was with a Williams College senior. She had expressed interest in the app because she does not understand some of the artworks she encounters at museums. She has taken a few art history courses; she does have a strong background in art. Because she did not know anything about the project, we prefaced the test by giving her the same scenario as above and explaining that the app is meant to help people learn more about art pieces. The test was also conducted in Sawyer.
 
Our heuristics evaluations were carried out as part of an in-class exercise with two different groups. Joyce and Stephanie executed the first evaluation which was performed by Karl. Cliff facilitated the last evaluation which was performed by Alyssa and Lester. The evaluators were quite familiar with our project and a good knowledge of Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The groups simulated first time users, asked questions, noted any heuristics broken and indicated the severity.

## Summary 

Conducting usability tests and heuristic evaluations provided helpful insight into problems and challenges that might be encountered by users. Letting the test participants read out loud, and ask questions, helped us understand their thought process while using the app. Several issues were identified through the usability test and heuristics. The usability tests highlighted that some of our design choices needed to be better refined to be clearly understood by the users. Heuristic evaluations provided a systematic way to evaluate our app design. Our use of different group with different levels of experience for our use cases made our testing process effective.
